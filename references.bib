abstract = {{Investors' searches for successful forecasting models cause the data      generating process for financial returns to change over time, which means      that individual return forecasting models can, at best, hope to uncover      evidence of 'local' predictability. We illustrate this point on a suite of      forecasting models used to predict US stock returns, and propose an      adaptive forecast combination approach. Most of the time the forecasting      models perform rather poorly, but there is evidence of relatively      short-lived periods with modest return predictability. The short duration      of the episodes where return predictability appears to be present and the      relatively weak degree of predictability even during such periods makes      predicting returns an extraordinarily challenging task. ?? 2007      International Institute of Forecasters.}},

abstract = {{This paper finds statistically and economically significant out-of-sample portfolio benefits for an investor who uses models of return predictability when forming optimal portfolios. Investors must account for estimation risk, and incorporate an ensemble of important features, including time-varying volatility, and time-varying expected returns driven by payout yield measures that include share repurchase and issuance. Prior research documents a lack of benefits to return predictability, and our results suggest that this is largely due to omitting time-varying volatility and estimation risk. We also document the sequential process of investors learning about parameters, state variables, and models as new data arrive.}},
